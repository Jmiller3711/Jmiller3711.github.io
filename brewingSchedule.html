					<h3>Schedule</h3>
					<p>I have a yearly goal to brew at least eight times a year. This should keep my tap handels from becomming dry. 
					As of 2017, I decided to abide by a brewing schedule that consists of four "staple" beers: Irish Red, Fruity Blonde, Pumpkin Porter, and Coffee Stout. 
					Each year, I try to improve upon last years recipie.</p>
					<h3>Irish Red</h3>
					<p>My favorite style of beer, perfect amount of maltiness. This beer won 2nd place in a homebrew compitition in 2017.
						Has to be on tap for St. Pattys Day!
					</p>
					<h3>Fruity Blonde</h3>
					<p>I plan on mixing up the fruit in this beer each year. In 2017 the fruits were peach and raspberry, very refreshing on a hot summer day.</p>
					<h3>Pumpkin Porter</h3>
					<p>It's starting to get cold out, better switch to the darker beers. This beer is great with some Halloween movies and Kit-Kats. </p>
					<h3>Coffee Stout</h3>
					<p>Not only is it cold oustide, now it's dark by the time you get home because of Daylight Savings Time. 
						What's better than an after work Coffee Stout to keep you up a while longer past your bedtime. </p>
