                        <li>Thoroughly enjoyed the book! I’m not a huge fan of video games, but loved the book … and couldn’t
                            “put it down” once I started reading it.
                            <br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li>I’ve always thought of video games as just that … games. But this book showed that there really can be
                            a number of good “real-world” uses, and educational opportunities from video games. It certainly
                            wouldn’t surprise me if at some point, even in my lifetime, we’ll actually see kids going to school via VR.
                            <br><br>
                            Additionally I like to think about the places you could visit thru VR. It’s always really hard to decide
                            where you want to go on vacation, but if you could visit each place you had interest in thru VR, that
                            would help you decide which of those places you really want to visit in person .. and which are just fine
                            having “seen” thru VR.
                            <br><br>

                            I really liked Art3mis. While I never got into the video game scene, I can so relate to any females who
                            are “geeky” and excel in the STEM world!

                        <li>I REALLY liked this book, and before I say why, I have to briefly tell this story….
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I was on the phone to Elise and she was telling me she was headed to see the movie Ready Player One…. I screamed to her how jealous I was because I’ve been itching to see the movie since it came out, but just haven’t been able to make it happen.  Then she said “What ever you do, don’t see the movie just yet …. Read the book first”!    
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Well that was great advice and so let me just say “Thank you Elise… you were right on”.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Ok, I loved this book first and foremost because I’ve been bitten by the Virtual Reality Bug (VRB).  I’ve never been that guy who sits around and plays video games, but on something of a whim I bought an Oculus, and since playing my first immersive game in VR, I’ve definitely got VRB fever!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I’ve spent some time thinking how VR will change our lives in the future, not just from a gaming aspect but from a social aspect…. But now I realize how feeble these thoughts were because Ernest Cline has taken it to a completely new level… and one I’m not entirely sure will be too far off.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                You know how when you believe something and when you tell others they nod their heads politely and you can tell they think you’re a little nuts…… well, that’s been me when I exude how I feel about the game Lone Echo, or playing Chess in VR, or thinking what it would be like to transport myself into Paris and be forced to practice my French on the streets all while I sit in my office.  
                            <br>
                            <br>
                                So Ready Player One has given me a fresh sense of optimism and gratification on the small amount of time I’ve spent thinking I’m in a virtual world while I’m still in this one.  It’s fun for me to ponder how VR will evolve over time and the many ways it could change our lives…. and Ready Player One does an amazing job of forecasting one scenario.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            </li>
                        <li>
                            For me it was clearly James Halliday.  He and I would have been near the same age and many  of the things which were discussed about his life were nearly exact duplicates of how I grew up.  
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            While I wasn’t the consummate gamer he was, there are so many parallels it was uncanny.
                        </li>
