    	<h1>Yo, welcome to the tutoring homepage! Obviously, this page is under construction or else you would be seeing some really cool shiz.</h1>
    	<p>
			A little bit about myself:
			I recently graduated from KU with a B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering (2014) and am now working for a company in downtown KC. While I was a student at KU I tutored a handful of math courses for KU AAAC (Academic Achievement and Access Center). I absolutely love teaching and hope that one day I can retire from engineering to teach full time! 

			I have tutored the following classes at KU:
			Pre-Algebra (MATH 002)
			Algebra (MATH 101)
			Business Calculus (MATH 115)
			Business Calculus II (MATH 116)
			Engineering Calculus (MATH 121)
			Engineering Calculus II (MATH 122)

			Besides my tutoring experience through KU, I have tutored privately by putting out flyers and Craigslist adds just like I am doing now. I have taken several other math courses while in the school of engineering such as Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, and Statistics. I can help you in pretty much any math course you need! As a person who once struggled with math in High School, I love to see the light bulb turn on in my students heads! Whether you need some serious help with math or just need some reassurance, I am your guy!

			KU required that students evaluate their tutors at the end of each semester, I have posted my last evaluation as a tutor on my Google+ profile that you need to check out if you are considering getting a tutor!

			So far I am planning on meeting with students on the Plaza, KC Public Library Plaza Branch or on the UMKC campus. As I said before I already have a full time position as an engineer so I will only be available to tutor after 4pm on the weekdays. 

			I am asking $25 per hour for my tutoring services. If you think this is too much consider finding some friend(s) or classmate(s) who also need a tutor, you can all attend for the same rate! (I'm keeping this to a maximum of 3 though, just so I have enough time to help everyone individually). 

			Rates:
			$25/hour weekdays
			$30/hour weekends
			Rates will also be higher depending on meeting location. As I stated above, I prefer to meet near the Plaza area. 

			Drop me an email or shoot me a text/call if you're interested. 
			I look forward to helping you win at math!
