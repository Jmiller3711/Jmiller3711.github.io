				<h3>A little bit about myself:</h3>
				I graduated from The University of Kansas with a B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2014. I am now working as a software engineer for a company in downtown KC. 
				While I was a student at KU, I tutored a handful of math courses for KU AAAC (Academic Achievement and Access Center). 
				</p>

				<p>
				<h3>I have tutored the following courses at KU:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Pre-Algebra (MATH 002)</li>
					<li>Algebra (MATH 101)</li>
					<li>Business Calculus (MATH 115)</li>
					<li>Business Calculus II (MATH 116)</li>
					<li>Engineering Calculus (MATH 121)</li>
					<li>Engineering Calculus II (MATH 122)</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
				<h3>More Experience:</h3>
				Besides my tutoring experience through KU, I have tutored privately by putting out flyers and posting ads on Craigslist. 
				I have taken several other math courses while in engineering school such as: Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, and Statistics. 
				I can help you in pretty much any math course you need! As a person who once struggled with math in High School, I love to see the light bulb turn on in my students heads.
				Whether you need some serious help with math or just need some reassurance, I can help! 
				KU required that students evaluate their tutors at the end of each semester, I have posted my last evaluation as a tutor on my Google+ 
				profile that you need to check out if you are considering getting a math tutor! 
				So far I am planning on meeting with students on the Plaza (coffee shop or Barnes and Noble), KC Public Library Plaza Branch, or on the UMKC campus. 
				</p>

				<p>
				<h3>Rates:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>$25/hour weekdays</li>
					<li>$30/hour weekends</li>
				</ul>
				Rates may increase depending on meeting location. As I stated above, I prefer to meet near the Plaza area. <br>
				If you think this is too much, consider finding some friend(s) or classmate(s) who also need a tutor, you can all attend for the same rate! (I'm keeping this to a maximum of 3 though, just so I have enough time to help everyone individually).
				</p>

				<p>
					<h3>Avaliablity:</h3>
					Beacause I have a full time position as a software engineer, I will only be available to tutor after 4pm on the weekdays. 
				</p>
