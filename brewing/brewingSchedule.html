					<h3>Schedule</h3>
					<p>I have a yearly goal to brew at least eight times a year. This should keep my tap handels from becomming dry. 
					As of 2017, I decided to abide by a brewing schedule that consists of four "staple" beers: Irish Red, Fruity Blonde, Pumpkin Porter, and Coffee Stout. 
					Each year, I try to improve upon last years recipie.</p>
					<h3>Irish Red</h3>
					<p>My favorite style of beer, perfect amount of maltiness. This beer won 2nd place in a homebrew compitition in 2017.
					</p>
					<h3>Fruity Blonde</h3>
					<p>I plan on mixing up the fruit in this beer each year. In 2017 the fruits were peach and raspberry.</p>
					<h3>Pumpkin Porter</h3>
					<p>It's fall and pumpkins are everywhere, let's put em in a beer. </p>
					<h3>Coffee Stout</h3>
					<p>The coffee in this beer is brewed in a french press with the wort and added during the boil! </p>
