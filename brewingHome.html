					<h3>Why do I Brew?</h3>
					It's more than just the end product. Brewing beer as a hobby has given me an appreciation for all styles of beer, 
					allows me to experiment, and gives me a great sense of pride.
					</p>

					<p>
					<h3>Brewing History</h3>
					My first brew was in a small 5 gallon kettle atop my apartment stove in downtown KC.
					Not knowing what I was getting into, I started my first brew at 8pm and finsihed somwhere around 2am, 
					which resulted in a long day at work the following day. 
					Check out my brewing history.

					<p>
					<h3>Brew Schedule</h3>
					I have a yearly goal to brew at least eight times a year. This should keep my tap handels wet year roung. 
					As of 2017, I decided to abide by a brewing schedule that consists of four "staple" beers: Irish Red, Fruity Blonde, Pumpkin Porter, and Coffee Stout.
					Each year, I try to improve upon last years recipie.
