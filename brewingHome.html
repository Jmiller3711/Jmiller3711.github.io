					<h3>Why do I Brew?</h3>
					It's more than just the end product.
					</p>

					<p>
					<h3>Brewing History</h3>
					My first brew was in a small 5 gallon kettle atop my apartment stove in downtown KC. 
					I'll never forget that first brew because I started at 8:00pm at night and had to work the next day. 
					To those who don't brew and are asking yourselves why starting at 8:00pm is a big deal, it takes a good 4-6 hours to brew beer. 
					For some reason, after reading the instructions, I thought it would take 2 hours tops. A pretty groggy day at work followed that first brew.

					<h3>Brewing Tools</h3>
					I have developed a few tools that come in handy for brew days and chores. Go check them out!

					<p>
					<h3>Brew Schedule</h3>
					I have a yearly goal to brew at least eight times a year. This should keep my tap handels wet year roung. 
					As of 2017, I decided to abide by a brewing schedule that consists of four "staple" beers: Irish Red, Fruity Blonde, Pumpkin Porter, and Coffee Stout.
					Each year, I try to improve upon last years recipie.
